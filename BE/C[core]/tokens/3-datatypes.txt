/*
A datatype defines the type of data a variable can hold. Here are the primary data types in C:

Basic Data Types:

int: Used to store integers (whole numbers). (+/-) : int num = 5;
float: Used to store floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points). (+/-) float price = 3523.56;
double: Used to store double-precision floating-point numbers. (+/-) double num = 9.98;
char: Used to store single characters. char var_name = 'a';


Derived Data Types:
Arrays: Collection of elements of the same type. int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
Pointers: Variables that store the address of another variable.int *ptr;
int var = 10;
ptr = &var;

Structures: Collection of different data types. struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float salary;
};

Unions: Similar to structures but share the same memory location.
union Data {
    int i;
    float f;
    char str[20];
};

Enumeration:

enum: User-defined data type consisting of integral constants.
enum week {Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday};

void:

void: Represents the absence of type. Commonly used with functions.

void functionName() {
    // Function code
}


Modifiers:

Data types can be modified using modifiers:

short ↓
long ↑
signed -5
unsigned 5

unsigned int num = 10;
short int num2 = 5;
long double num3 = 9.99;

Storage Classes

C also has storage classes that define the scope, visibility, and lifetime of variables:

auto
extern
static
register
