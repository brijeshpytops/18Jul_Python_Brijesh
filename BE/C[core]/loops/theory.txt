// loops are control structures that allow code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition. There are three primary types of loops in C:

For Loop:
The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

syntax:
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be executed
}


While Loop:
The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on a condition being true.

syntax:
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}

Do-While Loop:
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block is executed at least once before the condition is tested.

syntax:

do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
