URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a reference or address used to access resources on the internet. It specifies the location of a resource and the protocol used to access it. A typical URL consists of several components, including the protocol (such as http or https), the domain name (such as www.example.com), and a path to the specific resource (such as /page1.html).

http : HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is an application layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, enabling the retrieval of web pages from servers to clients (such as web browsers). HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.

s: SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a clientâ€”typically a web server (website) and a browser, or a mail server and a mail client. SSL ensures that all data transmitted between the web server and browser remains encrypted and secure from eavesdroppers or hackers. It has been succeeded by TLS (Transport Layer Security), but the term SSL is still commonly used to refer to both protocols.

Endpoints:Endpoints: In the context of networking and web services, an endpoint is a specific URL or URI where a web service or API is accessible and where interactions between clients and servers occur. Endpoints represent the various locations or resources available through an API or service, allowing clients to perform operations like retrieving, sending, or updating data.

For example, in a RESTful API:

GET /users might be an endpoint to retrieve a list of users.
POST /users might be an endpoint to create a new user.
GET /users/{id} might be an endpoint to retrieve details for a specific user.

DNS[IP/PORT]: IP (Internet Protocol) is a set of rules governing the format of data sent over the internet or other networks. It is responsible for delivering packets of data from the source host to the destination host based on their IP addresses. IP addresses uniquely identify devices on a network, enabling communication between them. There are two versions of IP currently in use: IPv4 and IPv6.

PORT : Port: In computer networking, a port is a logical endpoint for communication, used to identify specific processes or services on a device. Ports are identified by port numbers, which range from 0 to 65535. They allow multiple networked applications to coexist on a single device by directing incoming and outgoing data to the appropriate application. For example, HTTP typically uses port 80, and HTTPS uses port 443.

Query Parameters: In a URL, query parameters are key-value pairs used to pass additional information to the server. They are appended to the end of a URL following a question mark (?) and are separated by an ampersand (&).

For example, in the URL https://example.com/search?query=api&sort=desc, the query parameters are:

query=api
sort=desc
