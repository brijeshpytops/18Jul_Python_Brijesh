An identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, array, structure, or any other user-defined item. Identifiers are crucial in C because they give programmers a way to refer to different elements of the program in a readable and understandable manner.

Rules of identifiers:

1] [A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _] : level_1 = "Done"
2] you can not start with the digit: 1_level - False
3] white-space are not allowed : first name, total count
4] special char's are not allowed : @, #, $, %, ^, &, *..., first#name, #movie, @name
5] it must be unique: test = 2, int test(){}
6] keywords are not allowed: for, if, true..
7] it is a case-sensitive: first_name, FirstName, firstname, First_name, FIRSTNAME

What are the common naming conventions used in c programming?

snack_case: first_name, total_sum_of_nums
camelCase : firstName, lastName

- variables, function....

PascalCase : FirstName, LastName, Bank, BankWithAtm

- Class, Structure, Union...

â€¢ Trivial Variables: i,n,c,etc... (Only one letter. If one letter isn't clear, then make it a Local Variable).


x = 10
y = 20

Const Variables: ALL_CAPS.

PI = 3.14
